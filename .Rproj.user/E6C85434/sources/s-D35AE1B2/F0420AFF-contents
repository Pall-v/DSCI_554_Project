Findings
--------

1.  Discussing the results and findings of your survey and analysis of the survey data.

Sruvey design
-------------

1.  Discussing your survey/study design, specifically:
    -   what did you do well to make this study as causal as possible?
    -   what was not done well and how did that effect your studies conclusions?
    -   what would you do differently next time to improve your survey/study design and why?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Your target audience is other Data Scientists who are not familiar with your project.
-   Clearly introduce the survey topic and question you were interested in answering.
-   Link to your study's data and code in the methods section of your report.
-   Include effective visualizations and/or tables that help communicate your findings.
-   Your discussion should have 2 key focuses:

1.  Discussing the results and findings of your survey and analysis of the survey data.
2.  Discussing your survey/study design, specifically:
    -   what did you do well to make this study as causal as possible?
    -   what was not done well and how did that effect your studies conclusions?
    -   what would you do differently next time to improve your survey/study design and why?
