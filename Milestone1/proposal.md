# Proposal

### Identify the question that your team in interested in answering with the survey. The aim of the survey should be to try to answer one specific and testable question. Examples of specific and testable questions include (you can use one of these if you really like them):

DSCI 512 is a programming and algorithms course in the MDS program at UBC which introduces fundamental algorithms such as sorting and searching, as well as data structures. According to a poll done during the course, some students reflected that they have been experiencing a hard time with course materials and lab assignments. This leads to our survey question:

Does the level of programming experience prior to the MDS program influence a person's self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512 (Algorithms and Data Structures)?

### Identify the other questions you plan to ask in your survey to identify confounding variables and justify/explain why you plan to include them.

#### 1.0 Confounding Variable: Sex (type: category)

**Explanation**: Human are specialized into male and female. The study reported that the number of men works in the IT industry is much greater than the number of women. In other words, man is more likely to have programming experience. On the other hand, woman tend to be reactive and sensitive to stress and bad news [ref], which may affect the way woman perceives the level of difficulty when they take the course.

**Questions**: Sex?

**Options**: 1) Female, 2) Male

#### 2.0 Confounding Variable: Math Skills


**Explanation**: Mathematics is an essential skill when it comes down to learning algorithms. Algorithms utilized everywhere to provide solutions to problems, but developing algorithms requires strong logical thinking abilities. Mathematics is the formal study of logical consequences which is extremely important when understanding algorithms. Therefore, it is evident that your ability in math may affect your level of programming experience, as well as the difficulty in learning DSCI 512.

**Questions**: Among all the math courses you have taken in the past, in general, how were your grades compared to others? For example, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics.

**Options**: 1) Below average, 2) Average, 3) Above average


#### 3.0 Confounding Variable: Friends who have jobs associated with programming

**Explanation**: Undoubtedly, friends are more likely to share common values and interests. Hence,
if a MDS student have friends who work for IT companies, they are more likely to be affected and tend to have programming experience before the program. During the course, those friends can provide help and make the students less stressful when they have problems.

**Questions**: Do you have any friends who have jobs associated with programming?

**Options**: 1) No, 2) Yes


#### Main Covariate: Previous programming experience

**Explanation**:

**Questions**:

**Options**:(scale from 1 to 5, entry to expert)

#### Outcome variable: Self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512

**Explanation**:

**Question**: How difficult did you find DSCI 512 relative to the other courses in the MDS program?

**Options**: 1) Much easier than average, 2) Somewhat easier than average, 3) Average, 4) Somewhat more difficult than average, 5) Much more difficult than average.

### Describe how you plan to analyze the survey results (e.g., what statistical test(s) do you plan to employ?).

**Null hypothesis**: The level of programming experience prior to the MDS program does not influence a person's self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512.
**Alternative hypothesis**: The level of programming experience prior to the MDS program influences a person's self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512.

We plane to analyze the survey results in the following ways: 1) exploratory data analysis (EDA)
and 2) Regression Test.???

### Discuss the aspects of the UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys that are relevant to your proposed survey.

=======
According to the Office of Research Ethics document, the collection of opinions and information are considered personal information if the information could be linked or associated with the individual. Such data, if collected through a survey, must not be stored outside of Canada and should be surveyed through tools hosted within Canada. Some of the variables that we thought about including in our survey were potentially considered "personal information", such as an individual's age or gender. However, due to the small population of our MDS program, it is definitely easy for this type of information to be identifying. As we are also taking a privacy and ethics course, we understand that these issues can bring many unnecessary problems. Ultimately, we decided to some variables, such as age, from our survey, regardless of whether they are confounding variables or not.
