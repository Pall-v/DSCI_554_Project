1. Read UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys.

2. Identify the question that your team in interested in answering with the survey. The aim of the survey should be to try to answer one specific and testable question. Examples of specific and testable questions include (you can use one of these if you really like them):

Does the first programming language someone learns influence whether they prefer R or Python (or have no preference)?
Does a person's self-assessment of their knowledge of Git influence their Git tool of choice (e.g., command line, Github website, Git Kraken, Sourcetree, other)?
Does laptop operating system influence a person's self-rated enjoyment of the MDS program in the first block of the program?

Identify the other questions you plan to ask in your survey to identify confounding variables and justify/explain why you plan to include them.

3. Describe how you plan to analyze the survey results (e.g., what statistical test(s) do you plan to employ?).

4. Discuss the aspects of the UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys that are relevant to your proposed survey.

5. IMPORTANT - Do not include questions that will collect any personal information with your survey, or any questions could identify an individual or vulnerable groups.
