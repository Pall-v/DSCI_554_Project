### Identify the question that your team in interested in answering with the survey. The aim of the survey should be to try to answer one specific and testable question. Examples of specific and testable questions include (you can use one of these if you really like them):

DSCI 512 is a programming course in the MDS program at UBC, which introduces fundamental algorithm such as sorting and searching, as well as data structures. Some students reflected that they have been experiencing a hard time with course materials and lab assignments. This leads to our survey question:

Does the programming experience prior to the MDS program influence a person's self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512 (Algorithms and Data Structures)?

### Identify the other questions you plan to ask in your survey to identify confounding variables and justify/explain why you plan to include them.


#### 1.0 Confounding Variable: Sex

Explanation:

Question: Sex?

Options: 1) Female, 2) Male, 3) Other

#### 2.0 Confounding Variable: Math Skills

Explanation:

Question: How would you rate your math skills (relative to the general adult population)?

Options: 1) Much lower than average, 2) Somewhat lower than average, 3) Average, 4) Somewhat higher than average, 5) Much higher than average

#### 3.0 Confounding Variable: ???

Explanation:

Question:

Options:


#### Main Covariate: Previous programming experience

Explanation:

Question:

Options:(scale from 1 to 5, entry to expert)

#### Outcome variable: Self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512

Explanation:

Question: How difficult did you find DSCI 512 relative to the other courses in the MDS program? 

Options: 1) Much easier than average, 2) Somewhat easier than average, 3) Average, 4) Somewhat more difficult than average, 5) Much more difficult than average.

### Describe how you plan to analyze the survey results (e.g., what statistical test(s) do you plan to employ?).

Null hypothesis: The programming experience prior to the MDS program does not influence a person's self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512.

Alternative hypothesis: The programming experience prior to the MDS program influences a person's self-perceived difficulty regarding DSCI 512.

We plane to analyze the survey results in the following ways: 1) exploratory data analysis (EDA)
and 2) Regression Test.???

### Discuss the aspects of the UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys that are relevant to your proposed survey.
