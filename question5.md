5. Discuss the aspects of the UBC Office of Research Ethics document on Using Online Surveys that are relevant to your proposed survey.

According to the Office of Research Ethics document, the collection of opinions and information are considered personal information if the information could be linked or associated with the individual. Such data, if collected through a survey, must not be stored outside of Canada and should be surveyed through tools hosted within Canada. Some of the variables that we thought about including in our survey were potentially considered "personal information", such as an individual's age or sex. However, due to the small population of our MDS program, it is definitely easy for this type of information to be identifying. As we are also taking a privacy and ethics course, we understand that these issues can bring many unnecessary problems. Ultimately, we decided to some variables, such as age, from our survey, regardless of whether they are confounding variables or not.
