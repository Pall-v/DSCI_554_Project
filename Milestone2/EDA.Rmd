# 1.0 Data Wrangling  

In this milestone, we collected 56 observations from other MDS students, 554 TAs and lab instructor. Each observation contains five variables, including the followings in the table.

| Variable | Name | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Confounder | Sex | category |
| Confounder | Math Skills | ordinal |
| Confounder | Friends who have jobs associated with programming | category |
| Main Covariate | Previous programming experience | ordinal |
| Outcome | Self-perceived difficulty | ordinal |
